        <h1>a little bit of history...</h1>
        <p>
          A lot of us remember our childhood summer holidays at grandparentsâ€™
          village house. With a forest, river and pond nearby. Every national
          holiday, according to the season, most of families had a tea ceremony.
          For example on Trinity, Ukrainians have tradition of decorating the
          home with greenery, which is believed to protect against evil spirits.
          So people collect thyme, cornflowers and wild herbs and brew it then.
          In winter or early spring, when the snow had not yet melted, they
          enjoyed fruit teas or raspberry buds and small chopped sprigs of wild
          and cultivated cherries. Such teas used to be common in every rural
          home. Any gatherings with tea, both with friends and in the family
          circle, began with tea.
